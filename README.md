#### Installation

- Download the binary from the hndreader [GitHub Release Page](github.com/FrontSide/hnreader/releases)

  For example: To download and install version 1.1 for Linux, you may run the following.

  ```
  sudo curl -L https://github.com/Bunchhieng/hnreader/releases/download/v1.1/hnreader-v1.1.linux.x86_64 > /usr/local/bin/hnreader && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hnreader
  ```

- **or** install the Go package

  ```
  go get -u github.com/Bunchhieng/hnreader
  ```

  Note that **this option requires** you to have **Golang** already
  installed. You can install Go with your operation system's package manager or download it from [golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).

  Don't forget to set your GOPATH and PATH environment variables:

  ```
  export GOPATH=/path/to/your/go/workspace
  export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH
  ```

#### Usage

To use hnreader with its default options (Opens 10 news sites with Chrome), simply run:

```
hnreader r
```

To see all available flags for each command:

```
hnreader help r
```

OR

```
hnreader help rr
```

There are a number of customization options:

```
   --tabs value, -t value     Specify number of tabs   (default: 10)
   --browser value, -b value  Specify browser
   --source value, -s value   Specify news source (one of "hn", "reddit", "lobsters", "dzone", "devto", "steemit")   (default: "hn")
   --help, -h                 show help (default: false)
```

Examples with options:

```
hnreader r -t 31 -b "firefox"
hnreader r -b "brave" -s "reddit"
hnreader r -b "firefox" -s "reddit" -t 20
```

To use hnreader with a randomized source of news, run:

```
hnreader rr
```

The following options are available:

```
--tabs value, -t value Specify value of tabs (default: 10)
--browser value, -b value Specify browser
```

**Tip:** Create a bash alias (for Linux and macOS), if you are going to run the same command every morning.
You can do so by adding the following line (with your preferred options) to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file:

```
alias hnr='hnreader r -b "firefox" -s "Reddit" -t 30' >> ~/.bashrc
```
